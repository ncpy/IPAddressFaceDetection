IP Address Face Detection for counting input and output numbers of people.

I changed https://github.com/rushtehrani/simplemjpegview by adding Face Detection algorithm  and some OpenCV works, besides enabling choosing its own camera or local ip camera.

For testing, you can download https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ronakpatel1311.camerastreamer&hl=tr in another phone to use its ip address and to make resolution same.

All are done with Java using Android Studio.
